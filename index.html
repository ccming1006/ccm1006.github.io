      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Chuming Chen and I am a financial engineering student at Cornell University. I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at Grinnell College in 2022. As a student, I have always been interested in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, and finance, which led me to pursue my current field of study.</p>
      <p>Outside of academics, I have a passion for staying active and exploring the great outdoors. I enjoy bodybuilding, which has allowed me to challenge myself physically and mentally. I also find solace in rock climbing, where I can push myself to conquer new heights and overcome challenges. Golf is another activity that I enjoy, as it allows me to unwind and focus on precision and strategy.</p>
      <p>Overall, I am a driven individual with a thirst for knowledge and a passion for staying active. I am excited to continue pursuing my academic and personal goals, and I am eager to see where my studies and interests will take me in the future.</p>
